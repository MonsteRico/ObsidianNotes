# Day 5
## Minecraft Mods explanation
- How do Minecraft mods actually work?
	- Minecraft mods are written in a language called Java, as is Minecraft itself. We make mods in MCreator which turns the mods into code for us automatically.
	- Right click any mod element and open it in the code editor to see the actual code that makes that mod element work. Be careful, editing this will make it not work!
- What is Forge?
	- Forge is a modloader for Minecraft.
	- Basically Forge is able to read the files that mods are saved in and lets Minecraft actually accept them
## Export mods to .zip
- We will first export our mods to a .zip file. This lets you continue editing your mod at home, so long as you download MCreator.
- They will need to follow along closely
- In MCreator, first click Workspace at the top, then Workspace settings.
	- Rename the mod to whatever they want to call it. **ONLY CHANGE THE IN GAME NAME**, leave the other names as they are for ease.
	- Click "Save Changes" when done
- Click "Export Workspace to a Shareable ZIP". Careful, since the one below that is very similar but not the same.
- Save the file to the Desktop for ease, and have them name it their name
- When saving mods to flashdrives they can put that file on the flashdrives
## Export mods to .jar
- In MCreator, on the top right click this icon

  - Everyone will be exporting their mods at once, which may take some time
  - A popup will come up asking for donations. Click "Export the mod without donating"

  - Save the mod.jar file to the Desktop again and have them name it their name
  - This file can also be put on flashdrives when parents arrive
## Load mods into Minecraft
- Close out of everything and go back to the Desktop
- On the bottom left of the screen should be a search bar. Click on it and then type "%appdata%" without the quotes. Then press enter. It will open a folder. Have them wait here while you check and make sure they all got it.
- In this folder, double click the .minecraft folder. Then double click the mods folder. (If you did optional setup stuff their might be other mods here already)
- Copy the mod.jar file from the Desktop into this folder, then close out of it.
- A lot of people will likely need help with these steps
## Play mods in Minecraft!
- Open up the Minecraft Launcher
- Click on the bottom left where it probably says "1.19" and change it to the forge installation. Then they can click play and let it load!
- Now that they are in Minecraft, everything is just like the dev environment just now it has their mod installed and its their own account
## Multiplayer server minigames
- I personally will have a server setup with a minigames type of map from my house that people can then connect to
- The other option is to have them play Hypixel or Mineplex or any other servers. However, these can't be done with other people as easily.
- They will need to go out of their modded Minecraft and change it back to 1.19 regardless
- Play some Minecraft minigames together basically
## Minecraft challenges
- Do various Minecraft challenges like
	- Who can do x the fastest?
	- Build battles
	- Most amount of x gathered in 10 minutes
