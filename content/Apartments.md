# Matthews wonderful apartment notes

Here's what I'm thinking.

# Options
- In terms of amenities all of these options have the same amenities with similar quality. Campus Edge has added in building heated bike storage but thats really the only difference
- Hub does not include cable and charges for water/sewage for split between building, electric for just unit
- Camp
## 3x3  Apt Hub - Nick/Kylee do whatever
- If Nick/Kylee wanted to live in Hub as well they'd be in same building with same amenities AND its pet friendly so they could
- ![[Pasted image 20220625160606.png]]
- One bathroom in room sadly, everything else looks like itd be fine. Rooms are small though
- Balcony is nice ig
- Pricing: $1075 for the above alone (balcony and one room with bathroom in it)
	- $1105 for one with balcony on the 10th floor which has private access (only people on that floor can go to it)
		- 65" smart tv, glass door showers and fancier showerhead, tile backsplash in kitchen, closet organizer, and light dimmers all included as well
	- $1135 for VIP w/ balcony
		- smart thermostat, 65" smart tv, in unit sound system, glass door showers and fancier showerhead, fridge w/ water and ice dispenser, tile backsplash, closet organizers, and light dimmers
	- $1045 for one with no balcony and NO bathrooms in rooms all across hall (below)
	- <img src="https://huboncampus.com/west-lafayette-state-street/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/0005_Sapphire3.png" width="400" />
- Security deposit of $200 and application fee of $50
- All prices subject to change but probably not by a lot
- parking around $100/month for noah
## 4x4 Apt Hub - Nick with us
- Kylee could live in Hub to be close since its pet friendly or whererever she wants, sorry doesn't impact me I'll help her look later
- Lots of floorplans available so gonna put on another note with prices [[Hub Floorplans]]
- 1-2 of 4 bathrooms are in rooms usually
- More money paid = bigger rooms obviously, these all seem like they'd be pretty nice. However, also have to deal with an apartment building and the parties and all of that. but they all seem like they'd actually be good
- Parking was around $100/month per person i think so not cheap
## 3x3 Apt Campus Edge - Nick/Kylee do whatever
- If Nick/Kylee wanted to live in Hub theyd be close but diff buildings and amenities and stuff. hard to bring milo to an apartment that doesnt allow pets too
- ![[Pasted image 20220625161857.png]]
- Two Bathrooms in rooms and the two deluxe rooms are bigger
- The tv is mounted next to the kitchen so sitting on the couch you end up looking kinda at the kitchen which is kinda weird imo but whatever
- Pricing:
	- Standard Bedroom (1 of us) $1034
	- Deluxe Bedroom $1054
	- Extra $50 to each persons for a terrace
	- Application fee $150 (non-refundable)
	- Security Deposit $200 (refundable
	- $80/month for Noahs parking in building. $40 for parking in chauncey square
## 4x4 Apt Campus Ege - Nick with us
- Kylee would have to figure something out, hub is closeby same as at hub though not my concern rn unfortunately
- ![[Pasted image 20220625162930.png]]
- This one doesn't have the TV mounted near the kitchen which i like better
- Pricing for above:
	- $764 for the standard bedrooms
	- $784 for the deluxe bedrooms
	- extra $50 a month each for a Penthouse version with
		- restricted access on top floor, nest thermostat, tile backsplash, sound bar speaker
	- Application fee of $150 and $200 for security
## 4x4(.5) Townhome Campus Edge - Nick with us still Kylee does something 
- Kylee could live in Hub to be close since its pet friendly or whererever she wants, sorry doesn't impact me I'll help her look later
## 4x4(.5) Townhome Campus Edge - Nick/Kylee do whatever
- If Nick/Kylee wanted to live in Hub theyd be close but diff buildings and amenities and stuff. easier to bring milo to a townhome that doesnt allow pets


# Hub
- [Hub](https://huboncampus.com/west-lafayette-state-street/)
- loud part of campus, seemed very party central first time i looked
- had sticky notes saying "Don't live here"
- most bathrooms not in rooms
- more expensive
- decent amenities, not exactly same as edge though
- OPPORTUNITY FOR A PRIVATE HOT TUB FOR 1000+ not that worth it but still
- pet friendly as long as its less than 30 lbs fully grown. milo cant be fat :)
- waitlist up for 23/24
- ive seen both good and bad reviews
# Campus Edge
- [Campus Edge on Pierce](https://www.americancampus.com/student-apartments/in/west-lafayette/campus-edge-on-pierce)
- a little set off from chauncey hill, so not AS bad in terms of loud part of campus probably
- doesn't allow more people on lease than rooms in an apartment
- really nice amenities
- living room layout kinda sucks everywhere but the 4x4.5 townhome
- the townhomes require us to have a 4th person
- most bathrooms not in rooms, some are
- has "deluxe" rooms where those people end up having to pay a little more rent
- not pet friendly apparently? even though i thought they were?
- registration for 23/24 opens in September
- ive seen both good and bad reviews

# Fuse
- [FUSE](https://www.liveatfuse.com/)
- expensive but nice supposedly
- no pool, but generally nice amenities it seems
- not pet friendly
- bathrooms not in rooms ever as far as i can tell
- i couldnt tour it, dont know anything else other than people say its not that bad
