# Quotes/thoughts
- "Despite serious public debate in the wake of each atrocity, these high-profile incidents have not elicited a meaningful policy response by the U.S. federal government to mitigate the risk of continued gun violence"
- "the most common policy lesson drawn following the Columbine school shooting was the need for more gun control"
	- we realize the need for gun control, yet we don't enact on it
	- this is partially due to the major influence that organizations such as the NRA can have when lobbying
	- but it's also partially just due to the policy makers personal decision for example
- "President Obama also pushed the Senators to vote on this ban (Peterson and Hook 2013). ==However, the outcome was "policy gridlocked" since most members of Congress were against this bill.== Eventually, it was defeated by a vote of 60 to 40 (Peterson and Hook 2013)."
	- Obama tried to get an assault weapons ban passed after Sandy Hook shooting but it was rejected
