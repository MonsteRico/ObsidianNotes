## Overall

The concepts aren't too hard to get a grasp of, with Taylor Series and Power Series being the hardest to understand.
What ends up being really hard is combining concepts and the actual algebra/work behind them.
As for lecture, I didn't go. I went to the first two lectures and gave up after that, Glubokov absolutely sucked.
**Avoid Glubokov at all costs**

Dr. Chen is the best Math Professor, easily.
