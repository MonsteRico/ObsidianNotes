Campus Edge has added in building heated bike storage but thats really the only difference\n- Hub does not include cable and charges for water/sewage for split between building, electric for just unit\n- Campus Edge i dont remember, but they do have cable and i dont think they make you pay water/sewage, its just electric\n- our current apt is 1259-1441 sq ft for reference\n- no matter where we go move in is almost always a week before school starts, we cant move in until aug 13-17 ish usually. sucks but we'll live\n## 3x3  Apt Hub - Nick/Kylee do whatever\n- If Nick/Kylee wanted to live in Hub as well they'd be in same building with same amenities AND its pet friendly\n- ![[Apartment Floorplans/Pasted image 20220625160606.png]]\n- One bathroom in room sadly, everything else looks like itd be fine. Rooms are small though\n- 1014 sq ft\n- Balcony is nice ig\n- Pricing: $1075 for the above alone (balcony and one room with bathroom in it)\n\t- $1105 for one with balcony on the 10th floor which has private access (only people on that floor can go to it)\n\t\t- 65\" smart tv, glass door showers and fancier showerhead, tile backsplash in kitchen, closet organizer, and light dimmers all included as well\n\t- $1135 for VIP w/ balcony\n\t\t- smart thermostat, 65\" smart tv, in unit sound system, glass door showers and fancier showerhead, fridge w/ water and ice dispenser, tile backsplash, closet organizers, and light dimmers\n\t- $1045 for one with no balcony and NO bathrooms in rooms all across hall (below)\n\t- ![[Apartment Floorplans/Pasted image 20220625172606.png]]\n\t- this one is 903 sq ft\n- Security deposit of $200 and application fee of $50\n- All prices subject to change but probably not by a lot\n- parking around $100/month for noah\n## 4x4 Apt Hub - Nick with us\n- Lots of floorplans available so heres all the floorplans we could choose from, click and you can see the upgrades [Purdue Off Campus Housing Floor Plans (huboncampus.com)](https://huboncampus.com/west-lafayette-state-street/floor-plans/)\n- all the prices are $1000 plus really, but the upgrades are kinda nice if we were to do them and the biggest one would be REALLY nice\n- id only really consider this option if nick is gonna join us with it and it is very expensive compared any of the other options\n- 1-2 of 4 bathrooms are in rooms usually\n- More money paid = bigger apartments obviously, these all seem like they'd be pretty nice. However, also have to deal with an apartment building and the parties and all of that. but they all seem like they'd actually be good\n- Parking was around $100/month per person i think so not cheap\n## 3x3 Apt Campus Edge - Nick/Kylee do whatever\n- If Nick/Kylee wanted to live in Hub theyd be close but diff buildings and amenities and stuff. hard to bring milo to an apartment that doesnt allow pets too\n- ![[Apartment Floorplans/Pasted image 20220625161857.png]]\n- 998 sq ft\n- Two Bathrooms in rooms and the two deluxe rooms are bigger\n- The tv is mounted next to the kitchen so sitting on the couch you end up looking kinda at the kitchen which is kinda weird imo but whatever\n- Pricing:\n\t- Standard Bedroom (1 of us) $1034\n\t- Deluxe Bedroom $1054\n\t- Extra $50 to each persons for a terrace\n\t\t- private terrace, side by side fridge, 50\" tv instead of normal one, sound bar, tile backsplash, nest thermostat\n\t- Application fee $150 (non-refundable)\n\t- Security Deposit $200 (refundable\n\t- $80/month for Noahs parking in building. \n\t- $40 for parking in chauncey square\n## 4x4 Apt Campus Ege - Nick with us\n- ![[Apartment Floorplans/Pasted image 20220625162930.png]]\n- This one doesn't have the TV mounted near the kitchen which i like better\n- 1287 sq ft total\n- Pricing for above:\n\t- $764 for the standard bedrooms\n\t- $784 for the deluxe bedrooms\n\t- extra $50 a month each for a Penthouse version with\n\t\t- restricted access on top floor, nest thermostat, tile backsplash, sound bar speaker, 60\" tv, sidebyside fridge with water/ice dispenser, modern kitchen?, walk in closets\n\t- Application fee of $150 and \n\t- $200 for security\n\t- $80/month for  parking in building. \n\t- $40 for parking in chauncey square\n- ![[Apartment Floorplans/Pasted image 20220625164142.png]]\n- This one has the weird living room/tv layout but gives matthew a premium bedroom! the real draw here is security deposit is waived for this one (right now at least)\n- 1307 sq ft (its in the premium bedroom though)\n- Same exact prices for everything except premium bedroom is $834 \n- and security deposit is $0 rn. has penthouse upgrade available too\n## 4x4(.5) Townhome Campus Edge - Nick with us still\n- we still get all access to amenities just not through the building, we have to outside and around to the front entrance to get to them. not a big deal imo\n- on the ground floor obviously, so easier to move into but also close to the street, but also more separated from the rest of the tenants as we are not connected to the hallways or anything\n- there are only 10 townhomes. out of those 10, 4 of them are the 4x4.5 so we'd have to move quick to get one of those. and then if we want one in general we have to move quick too cuz they all sell out within a day. all of them will be available for leasing next school year. would everyone be able to get information in quick enough is the question\n- ![[Apartment Floorplans/Pasted image 20220625164722.png]]\n- 1388 sq ft\n- Pricing:\n\t- same parking pricing and application/security deposits as above ones\n\t- $804/month for standard bedrooms,\n\t-  $824/month for deluxe bedrooms\n\t- slightly worse living/kitchen layout compared to the other option imo\n- ![[Apartment Floorplans/Pasted image 20220625165023.png]]\n- 1438 sq ft\n- Pricing:\n\t- same parking pricing and application/security deposits as above ones\n\t- $884/month for standard, \n\t- $904/month for deluxe\n\t- i like this layout better imo\n## 4x4(.5) Townhome Campus Edge - Nick/Kylee do whatever\n- If Nick/Kylee wanted to live in Hub theyd be close but diff buildings and amenities and stuff. easier to bring milo to a townhome that doesnt allow pets\n- Same exact options and pricing as above the only difference is we will end up with a fourth roommate somehow\n- Basically either Nick could apply and then not sign a lease, could apply and sign a lease and then later break it or relet it (meaning we find someone during the year to take it over), or he just doesn't go there with us and someone random gets matched with us. should he sign the lease and break it i believe they will just fill the spot unless he relets it himself. doing that takes all the financial burden off of him other than the breaking of the lease, the new person becomes responsible for everything\n## 3x3 Fuse, 4x4 Fuse\n- idk anything other than its supposed to be pretty nice and its by mackey and no pool\n## Other apartments off campus\n- would be MUCH cheaper, but we'd have to deal with possibly older apartments, possibly less bathrooms, possibly unfurnished, and DEFINITELY much harder to walk to campus and get to campus even with bike. most likely have to bus or drive and alejandro and i dont have a car. i also really like being able to go back to my room. worth looking into though as a possibility\n\n# Hub\n- [Hub](https://huboncampus.com/west-lafayette-state-street/)\n- loud part of campus, seemed very party central first time i looked\n- had sticky notes saying \"Don't live here\"\n- most bathrooms not in rooms\n- more expensive\n- nice amenities\n- OPPORTUNITY FOR A PRIVATE HOT TUB FOR 1000+ not that worth it but still\n- pet friendly as long as its less than 30 lbs fully grown\n# Campus Edge\n- [Campus Edge on Pierce](https://www.americancampus.com/student-apartments/in/west-lafayette/campus-edge-on-pierce)\n- a little set off from chauncey hill, so not AS bad in terms of loud part of campus probably\n- nice amenities\n- living room layout kinda sucks everywhere but the 4x4.5 townhome and one of the 4x4 apartments\n- the townhomes require us to have/find a 4th person\n- most bathrooms not in rooms, some are\n- has \"deluxe\" rooms where those people end up having to pay a little more rent\n- not pet friendly\n# Fuse\n- [FUSE](https://www.liveatfuse.com/)\n- expensive but nice supposedly\n- no pool, but generally nice amenities it seems\n- not pet friendly\n- bathrooms not in rooms ever as far as i can tell\n- i couldnt tour it, dont know anything else other than people say its generally pretty good like aspire\n- seems like aspire but more expensive to me honestly","lastmodified":"2022-07-31T03:13:45.562279837Z","tags":null},"/Calculus-2-MA-162":{"title":"Calculus 2 -

The only thing I have to add personally is the beginning \"Novice\" part where it says you should do it on the screen and have them watch, yeah don't just have them watch actually have them do it with you. Or watch it and then do it. They shouldn't just watch that part and then do Intermediate, they should do it themselves too IMO.\n- Another thing is the last thing in the camp involves letting them kind of just work on the other coding difficulties/languages within the current lesson. This is fine as long as it's not with an hour left, maybe even 30 minutes. If you give them too much time to mess around in this they will take it and play Minecraft. My recommendation is potentially do a Build Battle, Redstone Tutorial, the Minecraft Bingo etc. to eat up a little of that time and get them doing something interactive but still fun. The activities at the beginning of each PowerPoint are good as well for 10-15 mins plus 10-15 mins of freetime at the start while everyone arrives.\n- Minecraft Education Edition DOES allow multiplayer and it SOMETIMES works, don't know why. One person has to host and then the others join through the join code. It's pretty simple. It does work as long as everyone's using the CodeNinjas accounts, including the Sensei whos hosting if they are. \n- They like to do really big numbers, those can make the computer lag so make sure they know big numbers are generally bad. If you ever need to kill all mobs or something you can do\n\t- `/kill @e[type=zombie]` or `/kill @e[type=!player]` or etc.\n\t- also the commands `/time set day` and `/weather clear` are useful to know\n- In settings they can change personal game mode if needed\n\n# Day 1\n- Log in to education editions and play around until everyone gets there - 10-15 mins\n- camp introductions and rules etc. - 5-10 mins\n- Build Battle for warmup, 10-15 mins\n- Sequencing, talk about sequencing\n\t- Novice sequencing - 30 mins\n\t- Intermediate Sequencing - 30 mins\n- Break - 10-15 mins\n- Events talk about events\n\t- Novice events - 30 mins\n\t- intermediate events - 30 mins\n- Either advanced sequencing or advanced events or both - rest of time\n\t- Events application from the PowerPoint doesn't work\n# Day 2\n- Free time beginning for 10-15\n- Pixel Portraits warmup - 10-15 mins\n\t- Subject Kits, Art and Design, Pixel Portraits\n- Variables, talk about variables\n\t- Novice variables - 30\n\t- Intermediate Variables - 30\n- Break - 10-15\n- Expert Variables but here's the final code b/c the one they  have is broken - 30-45\n\t- ![[Codeninjas Camps/Pasted image 20220628112510.png]]\n- Do the Application in Variables, have them try and make the agent place some of the blocks! - rest of time, add free time at end if really necessary but should be good\n\n# Day 3\n- Freetime until everyone arrives - 10-15 mins\n- Build A Moat - 10-15 mins\n\t- It's in art and design\n\t- Encourage use of the agent, although chances are they won't use it\n\t- Try and use the agent on screen to code a moat of some kind just to have them see coding in the background\n- Novice Loops (Talk about loops as well) - 30 mins\n- Intermediate Loops - 30 mins\n- Break - 15 mins\n- Constructive Activity - 10ish mins?
