# Rhetorical Analysis
A [[Genre]] used for analyzing a (usually) scholarly article rhetorically.

- Rhetorical Analysis is a way to interpret a text to determine why it is or is not effective
	- Usually focuses on an authors [[Rhetoric|rhetorical]] decisions
	- e.g. is an author effective in reaching their [[Audience and Context|audience]] with a given element or paragraph of their text
- We usually have a thesis statement that sets up how we're going to break down the texts use of rhetorical strategies
	- This sets up our purpose and angle for our analysis
- An important element of rhetorical analyses are the Greek Appeals (the proofs)
- Logos - Appealing to common sense, beliefs, or values
	- Logic, reasoning
	- Does the author use sound reasoning?
	- Aligned with the text
- Ethos - Using reputation, experiences, and values of the author or an expert
	- Ethics? Authority or credibility
	- Does the author present their authority in a way that is credible?
	- Aligns with the author
- Pathos - Using feelings, desires, or fears to influence readers
	- Emotion
	- Are there moments when the author appeals to a sense of emotion?
	- Aligns with the audience

## Organizing an analysis
A Rhetorical Analysis is set up like most thesis driven essays

- Introduction
	- Identify subject of analysis with brief background information
	- State your purpose
	- State your thesis
		- Thesis should be specific, arguable, and supportable
	- The introduction should go from general (subject) -> specific (thesis)
	- Intro may need more context to familiarize audience with the text being analyzed
- Body
	- Include a brief summary of the text (connects to the last point above)
	- Analyze the text
		- Each body paragraph should focus on a single point of analysis
			- e.g. if we claim an authors use of Pathos affects their argument, that paragraph should only talk about Pathos
- Conclusion
	- Briefly wrap up the significance of the analysis
	- What does your analysis reveal about the rhetoric in the text?
	- Lead audience into ideas with the introduction and then back out of them with the conclusion to create effective framing
	- The conclusion should be specific (significance of this analysis) -> general (statement about use of rhetoric in the text)
