# Minecraft Modding Camp - Code Ninjas

## General Notes About the camp or for me running it and how i run it etc

- A Minecraft account is NOT required unless they want to play in Multiplayer at the end, in which case they need it
- It'll be useful for every sensei in the camp to have messed around in MCreator at least one time and have gone through themselves and figured out how to do most of the things the camp will cover. e.g. figure out how to make a texture, block, ore, tools, and add effects. Basically every sensei should know how to do Day 1 on their own and mess with it a bit. It's Minecraft, its fun
- Always manage expectations, a lot of these kids might come in thinking "I'm gonna make my own version of the Aether mod". They're not, definitely not anything that big in a week. They will get to make lots of cool stuff, and making stuff that big is always a possibility, but stuff like that takes a lot of time. We essentially don't want kids getting upset when they can't fully execute on their plans because either A they don't know how to or B not enough time.
- If someone DOES have a cool idea though, we should always try and help them do it. Some kids will have an idea like "I want to make poison coat for swords" or something. These are possible, we should help them with it if we can as long as it won't take a really long time.
- Tangential to the above, make sure we aren't giving priority to anyone, e.g. if one kid has a bunch of cool ideas we can't help JUST that kid. Also related we can't be doing all the code on these things for them. If they have ideas, HELP them make these ideas a reality, but don't do it all for them. I like to show them how to get started or help them get started and let them do the rest once they know a process.
- Try and pick up on what the kdis want to do the most. We can switch things around based on what the majority wants to do.
- - e.g. if eveyrone wants to make their own advancements, we (I) can look into how to do it and we can throw it in on Thursday, which I think should basically be "Miscellaneous and things ninjas wanna try as a group"
- I also need to make new instructions or find new instructions for installing forge 1.18.2 and their mod after they leave

## Day 1 - Intro, Ore, Tools - Armor, Potion Effects While wearing armor

- Play Minecraft until everyone arrives, just have them log in or use our accounts for singleplayer
- CAMP INTRO
  - THERE WILL BE NO MULTIPLAYER UNTIL THE END MAYBE THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO KNOW THEY USUALLY ALMOST ALWAYS WANT TO PLAY MULTIPLAYER AND WE CANT DO IT BECAUSE WIFIS WEIRD THATS THE REASON
  - Set expectations, you can make cool stuff really fast but really complicated stuff will always take time, and we might not have enough time to do it or go over it
  - We will give their parents instructions to download the mods and play them at home at the end if theyre wanted
  - As an icebreaker we do Name, Age/Grade, How long youve been playing Minecraft OR your favortie block/mob/item/biome/mod/...
- WE BEGIN
- Have everyone start MCreator and make their workspace. This will take about 10 minutes so we talk about the next thing WITH this
- Textures
  - How does Minecraft do textures? (ask) (also know)
  - it uses spritesheets basically, pulling from the spritesheet whatever face of the block is needed and putting it in the game
  - it also "unfolds" mobs to allow for their full textures to be displayed
  - Talk about how MC does textures and show some examples
- Make our first block
  - Make our own texture, completely custom (don't show templates yet)
  - Go create the block entity
  - Create a recipe for the block
  - Create a Creative Tab to hold our new block and all future stuff
    - Make the symbol our new block
  - Explain the different options available to use
- Play game and look @ our new block, build with it mess with it.
- Short break to let them mess around with recipe and block, maybe making new recipes for existing things.
- Come back together for an ore quiz smelting quiz etc
- Make our own ore, use texture maker and a random ore texture
- make the ingot/gem texture
- make the blocks and items
- Make the Smelting Recipe for the ore
- make it generate (part of making the ore)
- Find it in game!
  Rest of this is dependant on time
- Use the quick tools to make tools and armor for our ore
  - if someone wants to make custom textures we can help them do that
- if lots of time left add in potion effects to our armor or tools
  - intros the coding with very simple block code stuff
- At the end we do freeplay. make sure we pick up their ideas and what they wanna do to get some ideas ourselves

## Day 2 - Armor, Effects (if we didn't get them already) - Tree, Biome, Wood Stuff

- This may change based on what we get through day 1, we might go over armor and effects if we didnt already get to them
- Main thing this day is making a biome with all the textures and blocks it needs
- Talk about biomes
  - what is a biome? what about outside of minecraft?
  - what do biomes in minecraft need? (like what blocks)
  - biome quiz, list as many as we can
- Log Texture
- leaves texture
- Grass block texture (top layer block)
- underground block texture
- Make all the blocks. Use wood pack to make the wood and then change the texture into custom one
- Make Biome
  - go over the options and explain them
- Find our biome! (will have to generate a new world to find it)
  - if someones having trouble we should be able to do a /locate or something
- Depending on time remaining, we will either do another biome, freeplay, or MAYBE custom structures
- Custom structures
  - use a structure block, export as a thing, import into mcreator, add as a structure and allow it to spawn wherever

## Day 3 - Custom bipedal mob and various special effects or stuff for it

[[Modding Camp/Day 3 Mod Camp]]

- Today we make a mob
- beginning talk about mobs, types of mobs, what is a mob etc.
- Show an exmaple of the mobs we will make
- Go to skindex and make a skin for our mob
- download it
- make mob
- check it out
- try adding special effects
- special behaviors
- more mobs, their drops weapons etc whatever
- i need to look into making this stuff more
- make this day involve more code than the previuos ones

## Day 4 - Misc. stuff day

[[Modding Camp/Day4]]

#### Enchantments, ranged weapons, food

- This stuff can be sprinkled in elsewhere if needed as well
- also include any cool things the kids wanted to do if we figured out how
- dimensions are a possibility too
- Enchantment - Vote on a follow along for autosmelt or lightning attacks or both:
  - follow the preset ones that I make essentially
  - magnetic enchantment that puts mined blocks straight in inventory is a possibility
  - maybe try making ideas the kids come up with on the spot
- Food
  - food textures and itesm and recipes
- Ranged weaopn custom bow type of weapon or a snowball type weapon

## Day 5 - Fun day

- Do any extra stuff they want to do as walkthrough with everyone
- otherwise just free create, free play for the last hour
- server?
- EXPORT AT THE END
- have parents bring a flash drive and give them the file for forge thats needed, the jar file for the mod, and the instructions
