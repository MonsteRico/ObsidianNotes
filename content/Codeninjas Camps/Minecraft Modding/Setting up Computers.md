## Programs needed
- Java (newest version)
- Minecraft Launcher
- MCreator
- Forge (file is downloaded and then it installs into Minecraft)
## The process
- Search for Java, if it's not there install it. Otherwise just go to Check For Updates and check for any updates
- Go to %appdata%, delete the .minecraft folder. This wipes all existing mods, worlds, and account info so don't do this if you need to save any for any reason
- Open up Minecraft, log in to your account, play 1.19
- Let it download and load
- Quit game, Google minecraft forge, download 1.18 installer latest (will lead to an ad thing, just hit skip in the top right once it waits)
- Run the file it downloads, Install client. Install. Let it install
- Go back into Minecraft Launcher, run the forge version once
- Change version back to 1.19 (not as important), logout (very important)
- Open MCreator
	- If there's any existing files go to C:/Users/codeninjas user/ and delete MCreatorWorkspaces
	- If it says there's an update do the update and uncheck the box that says Keep caches or something
		- It will have to remove the old version and then install the new one, it's weird
	- If it's empty and doesn't ask for an update then it's all good
- Lastly open MCreator and create a Workspace named something kind of weird or funny or using a random generator or something
	- Making workspaces in MCreator can take a REALLY long time, it's best to have this done before camp starts and have them rename when exporting
## Optional, you don't have to do this I just think it'd be cool
- Install some popular 1.18 mods into Minecraft so they have extra stuff to play with on the last day. Don't tell them this, just make it a surprise!
- Popular mods I would use
	- Biomes O' Plenty - adds a bunch of new biomes and blocks to the game
	- Alex's Mobs - adds a bunch of new creatures to the game
- You can google mods and download them form CurseForge. Place the .jar files into the mods folder. Make sure the mods are good for the version of Minecraft you are using and are good for Forge.
- This is totally optional, don't try and do it if you don't already know how.
