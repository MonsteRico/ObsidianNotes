## Day 1 - Intro, Ore, Tools

- Play Minecraft until everyone arrives, just have them log in or use our accounts for singleplayer
- CAMP INTRO
  - THERE WILL BE NO MULTIPLAYER UNTIL THE END MAYBE THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO KNOW THEY USUALLY ALMOST ALWAYS WANT TO PLAY MULTIPLAYER AND WE CANT DO IT BECAUSE WIFIS WEIRD THATS THE REASON
  - Set expectations, you can make cool stuff really fast but really complicated stuff will always take time, and we might not have enough time to do it or go over it
  - We will give their parents instructions to download the mods and play them at home at the end if theyre wanted
  - As an icebreaker we do Name, Age/Grade, How long youve been playing Minecraft OR your favortie block/mob/item/biome/mod/...
- WE BEGIN
- Have everyone start MCreator and make their workspace. This will take about 10 minutes so we talk about the next thing WITH this
- Textures
  - How does Minecraft do textures? (ask) (also know)
  - it uses spritesheets basically, pulling from the spritesheet whatever face of the block is needed and putting it in the game
  - it also "unfolds" mobs to allow for their full textures to be displayed
  - Talk about how MC does textures and show some examples
- Make our first block
  - Make our own texture, completely custom (don't show templates yet)
  - Go create the block entity
  - Create a recipe for the block
  - Create a Creative Tab to hold our new block and all future stuff
    - Make the symbol our new block
  - Explain the different options available to use
- Play game and look @ our new block, build with it mess with it.
- Short break to let them mess around with recipe and block, maybe making new recipes for existing things.
- Come back together for an ore quiz smelting quiz etc
- Make our own ore, use texture maker and a random ore texture
- make the ingot/gem texture
- make the blocks and items
- Make the Smelting Recipe for the ore
- make it generate (part of making the ore)
- Find it in game!
  Rest of this is dependant on time
- Use the quick tools to make tools and armor for our ore
  - if someone wants to make custom textures we can help them do that
- if lots of time left add in potion effects to our armor or tools
  - intros the coding with very simple block code stuff
- At the end we do freeplay. make sure we pick up their ideas and what they wanna do to get some ideas ourselves
