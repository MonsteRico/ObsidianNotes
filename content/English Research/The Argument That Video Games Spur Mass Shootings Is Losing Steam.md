# Quotes/thoughts
 - "In addition to “broken families” and “declining church attendance,” he said, “desensitizing the act of murder in video games” has contributed to the epidemic of mass shootings." - Ted Cruz said this stuff, article quotes him
	 - The idea that video games lead to mass shootings and increased levels of violence is still being spouted out by people. What's worse is these people are in influential spots in government, like Senator Ted Cruz here.
 - "Most coverage of Cruz’s comments (and Fox’s interview) were in the service of invalidating the question itself"
	 - This subject has been researched so much that anytime its brought up it is practically ignored at this point. So why is anyone still using it as a reason?
 - "'You see half-hearted attempts by Ted Cruz and a few other people bringing up video games, but there’s not much enthusiasm behind it,' Ferguson said. 'I don’t think anyone’s biting at the apple anymore.'" 
 - "Stanley Pierre-Louis, president and Chief Executive Officer of the Entertainment Software Association, agrees. “The frequency of the arguments have lessened,” he said. “When they do arise, policymakers are rebutting those with the evidence that's on the record.”"
 - "interesting to see violent video games brought up less and less often around mass homicides. A glance at Google Trends shows a broader decline in searches on “video game violence” generally since 2004."
 - "Notably, other countries with similar rates of video game play don’t have similar rates of gun violence."
