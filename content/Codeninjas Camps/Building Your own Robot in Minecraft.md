# Building Your Own Robot in Minecraft

Overall the slides for this camp are actually really good, just follow them. The only thing I have to add personally is the beginning "Novice" part where it says you should do it on the screen and have them watch, yeah don't just have them watch actually have them do it with you. Or watch it and then do it. They shouldn't just watch that part and then do Intermediate, they should do it themselves too.
