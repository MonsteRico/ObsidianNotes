# Quotes/thoughts

	- We continously use the same reasons and same stereotypes but never make any improvements
- "the U.S. Supreme Court declared in 2011 that scientific studies had failed to link violent games to serious aggression in kids"
- "It's time to lay this myth to rest."
	- in reference to video games causing violence
	- this myth has been around too long, this is a good closing paragraph quote
- "mental illness, such as psychosis as well as a mixture of depression with antisocial traits, is a risk factor for violent behavior."
	- There are other reasons for these mass shootings that we could be exploring that just haven't received the same level of attention
- "improving access to mental health services would benefit a whole range of people and, by coincidence, occasionally bring treatment to someone at risk of committing violence. But focusing only on mental health is unlikely to put much of a dent in societal violence"
	- Improving mental health services would help, but it can't be the only thing we do. This isn't a set it and forget it type of deal, it takes effort that we are neglecting to put in
