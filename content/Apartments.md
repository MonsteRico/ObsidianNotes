# Hub
- loud part of campus, seemed very party central first time i looked
- had sticky notes saying "Don't live here"
- most bathrooms not in rooms
- more expensive
- decent amenities, not exactly same as edge though
# Campus Edge
- a little set off from chauncey hill, so not AS bad in terms of loud part of campus probably
- doesn't allow more people on lease than rooms in an apartment
- really nice amenities
- living room layout kinda sucks everywhere but the 4x4.5 townhome
- the townhomes require us to have a 4th person
- most bathrooms not in rooms, some are
- has "deluxe" rooms where those people end up having to pay a little more rent
# Rise
- on chauncey hill, louder part of campus
- supposedly has eleveator problems in a 10 floor building
- some problems with management
- rooftop pool though
- not pet friendly
# Provenance

- cant get apartments until 60 days before it becomes available, so hard to guarantee we're set
- amenities are lacking compared to others, still nice though
- no furniture included
- pet friendly
# Fuse
- expensive but nice supposedly
- no pool, but generally nice amenities it seems
