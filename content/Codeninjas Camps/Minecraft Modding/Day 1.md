## Day 1 - Intro, Ore, Tools
- Play Minecraft until everyone arrives and gets logged in, just have them log in or use our accounts for singleplayer
## Intro
- Chris will go over general rules
- As an icebreaker we do Name, Age/Grade, How long you've been playing Minecraft OR your favorite block/mob/item/biome/mod/etc.
- Have everyone start up MCreator and go into their Workspace.

## Talk about textures
-  Close computers halfway while we talk about textures
- How does Minecraft do textures? (ask the ninjas)
- It uses sprite sheets basically, pulling from the sprite sheet whatever face of the block is needed and putting it in the game
- ![[Pasted image 20220621211602.png]]
- It also "unfolds" mobs to allow for their full textures to be displayed

- Can anyone figure out this mob? (ask, I think its a fox I honestly don't know.)
- Google Minecraft textures/Minecraft mob textures and show some more examples. Ask them what they notice and talk a bit about textures.
- Talk more about how Minecraft does textures if you know and/or are stalling for time for some reason

## First Block
- First thing we will do modding-wise is make our first block
- I recommend breaking the steps down and doing it as follows. Do each bullet point on screen and have them watch it, then have them do that part.
- Make a new Texture
	- [[Codeninjas Camps/Minecraft Modding/Texture Making|Texture Making]] - full details on texture making
	- Go to resources, create new texture, create texture. There are restrictions on the names for a lot of things
	- The editor is basically MS Paint, it should be easy to explain and for them to use
- Make block element
	- [[Codeninjas Camps/Minecraft Modding/Block|Blocks]] - Full details on block mod elements
	- Go back to the workspace, click the ![[Pasted image 20220621212248.png]] green plus and make a block. 
	- On the first page (Visual section) they will have to put in their texture, that should be the only thing they have to mess with here
	- On the properties page they can change all the different settings on the block. You can go over some of the main ones like Hardness, In Game Name, and Creative Tab
	- Clicking on the question marks next to anything will bring up a little popup of what that thing does, **Make sure they know this it will save them and you time**
	- Don't spend too much time messing around with properties here, we want to get them to the point of seeing their new block in game. 
	- Make sure that before moving on everyone has the texture set up right, the in game name set up, and the
- Short break to let them mess around with recipe and block, maybe making new recipes for existing things.


- Come back together for an ore quiz smelting quiz etc
- Make our own ore, use texture maker and a random ore texture
- make the ingot/gem texture
- make the blocks and items
- Make the Smelting Recipe for the ore
- make it generate (part of making the ore)
- Find it in game!
  Rest of this is dependant on time
- Use the quick tools to make tools and armor for our ore
  - if someone wants to make custom textures we can help them do that
- if lots of time left add in potion effects to our armor or tools
  - intros the coding with very simple block code stuff
- At the end we do freeplay. make sure we pick up their ideas and what they wanna do to get some ideas ourselves
