# Textures
Textures in MCreator are made using an MS Paint style of drawing canvas.

- To make a texture, first click the Resources tab on the left side ![[Codeninjas Camps/Minecraft Modding/Pasted image 20220621171552.png]]
- You then click the Create New Texture button, and then click Create Texture at the top to get this menu ![[Pasted image 20220621171713.png]]
- The Fill with options
	- Transparency - doesn't put anything in
	- Color - fills the canvas with whatever color you use
	- Template - click in the box it makes to choose a base texture to draw on and change the colors of. When making the first block in [[Codeninjas Camps/Minecraft Modding/Day 1|Day 1]] don't use this option, use the other two
	- No layer - don't use this, it creates a completely empty texture and it's confusing
- Width and Height should stay as 16, since that's normal Minecraft texture sizes
- The options and brushes are on the left.

- There's undo and redo, pencil, line, shapes, eraser, stamp (not useful imo), bucket, and eye dropper. All work exactly as you expect.
- You can change colors by clicking on the color and choosing a new one. The tool properties are below that (where it says Pencil in the picture above). All fairly obvious.
- Drawing is easy, just left click. Like I said it's MS Paint.
- When you're done hit Save as New Texture or Save this Texture in the top right
- It'll ask you for a name for the texture. There are certain restrictions on the names, make sure they follow them!

- To go back to the main mod menu click on the X in the tab for the texture (if its still open) and then click Mod elements on the left
