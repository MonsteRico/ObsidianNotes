The only thing I have to add personally is the beginning \"Novice\" part where it says you should do it on the screen and have them watch, yeah don't just have them watch actually have them do it with you. Or watch it and then do it. They shouldn't just watch that part and then do Intermediate, they should do it themselves too IMO.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnother thing is the last thing in the camp involves letting them kind of just work on the other coding difficulties/languages within the current lesson. This is fine as long as it's not with an hour left, maybe even 30 minutes. If you give them too much time to mess around in this they will take it and play Minecraft. My recommendation is potentially do a Build Battle, Redstone Tutorial, the Minecraft Bingo etc. to eat up a little of that time and get them doing something interactive but still fun. \u003cbr\u003e\nI also really like the Minecraft Bingo and think it should be an every day thing, but judge the camps reaction to it.\u003cbr\u003e\nMinecraft Education Edition DOES allow multiplayer and it DOES work.

Triggers are questionable, if you come up with ideas youre welcome to show them\n  - In the AI and goals, you can show off what some of the AI goals do, but the main thing to do here is get rid of everything except the top block and then click **AI Templates** and choose one to use, probably Basic passive, aggressive towards player, or aggressive when hit.\n  - Under the last section spawning they can change whether their new mob spawns like monsters, creatures, etc. Thats the only setting they should probably change on this page, but as per usual the question marks can explain the settings more.\n\nThere isn't anything else to do for this day, I honestly think those two things will take a large amount of time for them to follow along with and/or mess around with. If you feel like theres too much time left you can add in stuff like adding effects to armor or doing more complicated effects etc. Otherwise I'd kind of just give them time to develop their mods, they know how to do items, blocks, tools, biomes (i think at least), mobs, and some basic effects on those things.\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-22T01:27:08.703437708Z","tags":null},"/Codeninjas-Camps/Minecraft-Modding/Day-4":{"title":"Day 4","content":"\n# Day 4 MC Modding Camp\n\n#### Enchantments, ranged weapons, food\n\n- Enchantment\n  - Add Mod element for enchantment.

Only give it the texture, don't change any other settings for this item\n    - Create a Ranged Item\n      - Choose the texture they made\n      - Item Animation, what the item will act like when they use it.\n      - Max stack size 1\n      - Item for ammo, set to the item they just made\n      - Shoot constantly while active - optional for their weapon\n      - Item usage count - durability\n      - they can chagne the sound if they want\n      - Under the projectile settings at the bottom, they can change the power, damage, knockback etc.\n      - Main thing to change there is the **Item representing texture of projectile**, change it to the item/texture they made.\n      - Triggers if they want to mess with them\n    - Add recipes for both the ammo and the weapon\n  - Snowball type ranged weapon\n    - Make texture for the snowball type thing **save as Item texture**\n    - Create a ranged item\n      - Set the max stack size to something other than 1, it's how many can be in a stack. eg snowballs can have 16 in a stack\n      - set item animation to none\n      - set shoot constantly while active to true\n      - **set item usage count to 0**\n      - set the sound if they want to change it\n      - **IMPORTANT PARTS HERE**\n      - Set the item for ammo to _anything_ and the **Item representing texture of projectile** under projectile at the bottom to anything.\n      - After they save mod element, go back into it and set those two things to the ranged item they just finished making.\n        - basically MCreator won't let you choose the item youre currently making, so they have to save it and then go back in to choose that item\n      - Rest of the settings act the same\n      - Recipe as per usual\n- Food\n\n  - Owen said that when he did the camp they really liked making new food items, so I figured leave this for last and let them mess around with it the most and make what they want.\n  - Food stuff is pretty basic, it's make texture **save as Item texture**, make Item mod element, go to food properties and make it a food and change the properties\n\n- BONUS THINGS\n  - If for some reason the above stuff doesnt take up enough time, or we decide the last day needs some follow along content as well, here are some bonus things that can be done\n  - These are in order of difficulty, easiest to hardest\n- Potions\n  - Really simple\n  - Make a **potion item** mod element\n  - Name the different potions at the top, add effects at the bottom.\n    - The duration is in ticks, so 20 ticks per second \\* x amount of seconds = the duration they want\n    - Amplifier increases the level\n  - Theres no way to change the color of the potion that I can see, its just auto generated\n- Paintings\n  - Very very simple to do\n  - Download any image from the internet, save it to downloads (somewhere they can get to)\n  - Make a new painting\n  - Click the plus to add a new image, find their image\n  - Click the dropdown and choose their image\n  - The hardest part about this is the painting size, it lets you choose any size but paintings usually go across full blocks\n  - A single block is 16x16, so if they want it to be a 2x2 of blocks, it needs to be 32x32 pixels, if they want it to be a 4x4 of blocks, 64x64 and so on.\n    - Quick conversion table\n    - Width X Height in MCreator/in pixels ----- Width X Height in Minecraft/Blocks\n    - 16x16 --- 1x1\n    - 16x32 --- 1x2\n    - 32x16 -- 2x1\n    - 32x32 --- 2x2\n    - 64x64 --- 4x4\n    - I don't think Minecraft does any other sizes, but you get the idea those are the intervals\n- Plants\n  - Plants are another pretty easy one, they make a block texture for one side of the plant and MCreator generates the rest of it for them.\n  - It'll be a little hard when making textures but theyre more than welcome to try it out\n  - In Visual and type section, just choose the top/main texture and leave the rest of it\n  - skip bounding boxes\n  - properties can be changed as usual, question marks explain them better. These properties are mostly the same as the blocks\n  - I wouldn't mess with the advanced properties or triggers here at all\n  - In Generation they can mess with stuff, just know theyll have to make a new world to see it actually generate.\n  - The plants are difficult to create textures for imo, but not difficult to actually make\n- Dimension\n  - They will need textures for the item used to light the portal and for the portal itself\n  - Also will need a block to use for the portal frame, have to make the block mod element if they are making their own\n  - Properties\n    - I\"d recommend normal world gen\n    - Set a main filler block and fluid block\n    - Add any biomes they want to appear in this dimension (could even be the ones theyve made)\n    - Sky/fog color can be changed\n    - Whether to allow sleeping or not\n    - All the check marks are kind of obvious\n  - Portal Section\n    - Make sure dimension portal is enabled\n    - Portal frame block - this is the equivalent of obsidian for the nether portal\n    - Particles - the particles coming off the portal\n    - Luminance - how much it lights up\n    - Igniter item name - name of the item used to ignite the portal eg flint and steel\n    - set the textures for the igniter item and the block at teh bottom\n  - As far as I can tell theres no way to craft the item for the custom portal, itll have to be a creative only thing i think\n  - This entire thing is likely to be buggy but if they wanna do it the option is there\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-22T01:27:08.703437708Z","tags":null},"/Codeninjas-Camps/Minecraft-Modding/Minecraft-Modding-Camp-Notes-Codeninjas":{"title":"Full Camp","content":"\n# Minecraft Modding Camp - Code Ninjas\n\n## General Notes About the camp or for me running it and how i run it etc\n\n- A Minecraft account is NOT required unless they want to play in Multiplayer at the end, in which case they need it\n- It'll be useful for every sensei in the camp to have messed around in MCreator at least one time and have gone through themselves and figured out how to do most of the things the camp will cover. e.g. figure out how to make a texture, block, ore, tools, and add effects.

They're not, definitely not anything that big in a week. They will get to make lots of cool stuff, and making stuff that big is always a possibility, but stuff like that takes a lot of time. We essentially don't want kids getting upset when they can't fully execute on their plans because either A they don't know how to or B not enough time.\n- If someone DOES have a cool idea though, we should always try and help them do it. Some kids will have an idea like \"I want to make poison coat for swords\" or something. These are possible, we should help them with it if we can as long as it won't take a really long time.\n- Tangential to the above, make sure we aren't giving priority to anyone, e.g. if one kid has a bunch of cool ideas we can't help JUST that kid. Also related we can't be doing all the code on these things for them. If they have ideas, HELP them make these ideas a reality, but don't do it all for them. I like to show them how to get started or help them get started and let them do the rest once they know a process.\n- Try and pick up on what the kdis want to do the most.

Figure out what x and dx should become and sub those into the integral. Solve the integral, likely using a bunch of trig stuff from above. At the end make sure you convert theta back into x.
