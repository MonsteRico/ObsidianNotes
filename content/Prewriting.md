- The first stage of the [[Writing Process]] is just coming up with ideas, also known as prewriting
- Three main ways to come up with ideas are
	- Prewriting - use of visual and textual/verbal strategies to just get ideas down on paper
	- Heuristics - Time tested techniques that help you ask good questions to figure out what information you need to support your thesis or claim
	- Exploratory writing - reflective strategies to help you understand the topic and how you feel about it

# Prewriting
- Concept mapping, clustering ideas together
- Free writing, just write as much as you can to get ideas going
- This is a part of the writing process, so if it's done right then it will greatly help during [[Drafting]] and [[Revising]]
- Any plan is better than no plan. It gets you started writing at least.
