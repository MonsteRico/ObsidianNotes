# Matthews wonderful apartment notes
# Hub
- [Hub](https://huboncampus.com/west-lafayette-state-street/)
- loud part of campus, seemed very party central first time i looked
- had sticky notes saying "Don't live here"
- most bathrooms not in rooms
- more expensive
- decent amenities, not exactly same as edge though
- OPPORTUNITY FOR A PRIVATE HOT TUB FOR 1000+
- pet friendly as long as its less than 30 lbs fully grown. milo cant be fat :)
- waitlist up for 23/24
- Hub reviews are awful and said Rise is 100% better
# Campus Edge
- [Campus Edge on Pierce](https://www.americancampus.com/student-apartments/in/west-lafayette/campus-edge-on-pierce)
- a little set off from chauncey hill, so not AS bad in terms of loud part of campus probably
- doesn't allow more people on lease than rooms in an apartment
- really nice amenities
- living room layout kinda sucks everywhere but the 4x4.5 townhome
- the townhomes require us to have a 4th person
- most bathrooms not in rooms, some are
- has "deluxe" rooms where those people end up having to pay a little more rent
- not pet friendly apparently? even though i thought they were?
