- We have access to a LOT of databases
	- They can all be accessed through the Purdue Library website
- Databases have collections of articles usually of a single discipline
- JSTOR and Academic Search Complete are good general ones
- You can use AND OR and NOT to change search results
- Always try to limit to **linked full text** and **scholarly** sources only
- Use authors last name when saving file, since that's part of how you cite it
- Name files smartly so they're easy to keep track of and fine later
- Tips & tricks for database searches
	- Vary search terms, use synonyms
	- Try multiple databases, not all have same articles
	- Use AND OR NOT
	- Limit searches to scholarly articles only
