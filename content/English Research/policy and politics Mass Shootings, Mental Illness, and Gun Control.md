- "Local law enforcement agencies alone received at least forty-five calls about Cruz or his brother in the prior ten years, most involving allegations of erratic behavior, domestic violence, or elder abuse. Despite this, Cruz was never taken into custody or referred for mental counseling. He was also able, under current federal and state laws, to legally obtain ten guns, including the AR-15-style assault rifle used in the school shooting"
	- Basically they likely needed help, but couldn't get it. And even though they needed that help, they were perfectly able to get AR-15s and ended up causing lots of harm because of it
- "Moreover, new data suggest that more than half of the nearly two hundred mass shootings that took place in the United States since 1900 were carried out by those either diagnosed with a mental disorder or with demonstrable signs of serious mental illness prior to the attack"
	- Huge for the mental illness being a cause section
- "Mass shootings are indeed partially a mental health problem, albeit one poorly addressed by our current laws and policies."
- It is really easy for people with serious mental health problems to pass background checks. (Paraphrased citation)
- "Until all sides of the debate—left and right, those focusing on mental health and those worried about gun control—put aside their political animosity and engage in a real debate, none of our current policies or proposals will do even little to stem the rising tide of gun violence in this count"
	- They need to just get moving and stop arguing about the reason behind it and instead just fix it by tackling them both instead of arguing which is the real reason.
