The Minecraft Modding camp uses MCreator. It will require a Minecraft Java edition account to participate in Multiplayer activities on the last day and to run fully exported mods locally. I highly recommend that anyone who runs this camp be familiar with Minecraft at the very least. I also would recommend that anyone running this camp use MCreator and try and go through the first day on their own. MCreator as a program isn't too difficult to understand, but it is useful to know how everything works and where the buttons are. On this page are links to more detailed notes for each day of the camp. I have also included a general overview of each day here as a quick reference. I have also linked at the top to any other notes related to this camp.

## Other Notes
- [[Codeninjas Camps/Minecraft Modding/Block|Block]] - Describes everything about the Block mod element. Good reference if you don't understand any properties on the blocks. Also a good reference as to level of detail that should be included in potential notes on every mod element for a club type setup.
- [[Codeninjas Camps/Minecraft Modding/Setting up Computers|Setting up computers]] - Has a list of the programs needed for each computer and how to set everything up. Also has instructions on clearing the computers for a second running of the camp.
- [[Codeninjas Camps/Minecraft Modding/Texture Making|Texture Making]] - Describes everything to do with making textures. Same as the block, this is what I would be doing for everything in MCreator for club notes
