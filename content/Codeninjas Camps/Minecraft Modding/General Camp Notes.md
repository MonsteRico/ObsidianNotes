# Minecraft Modding Camp - Code Ninjas

## General Notes About the camp or for me running it and how i run it etc

- A Minecraft account is NOT required unless they want to play in Multiplayer at the end, in which case they need it
- It'll be useful for every sensei in the camp to have messed around in MCreator at least one time and have gone through themselves and figured out how to do most of the things the camp will cover. e.g. figure out how to make a texture, block, ore, tools, and add effects. Basically every sensei should know how to do Day 1 on their own and mess with it a bit. It's Minecraft, its fun
- Always manage expectations, a lot of these kids might come in thinking "I'm gonna make my own version of the Aether mod". They're not, definitely not anything that big in a week. They will get to make lots of cool stuff, and making stuff that big is always a possibility, but stuff like that takes a lot of time. We essentially don't want kids getting upset when they can't fully execute on their plans because either A they don't know how to or B not enough time.
- If someone DOES have a cool idea though, we should always try and help them do it. Some kids will have an idea like "I want to make poison coat for swords" or something. These are possible, we should help them with it if we can as long as it won't take a really long time.
- Tangential to the above, make sure we aren't giving priority to anyone, e.g. if one kid has a bunch of cool ideas we can't help JUST that kid. Also related we can't be doing all the code on these things for them. If they have ideas, HELP them make these ideas a reality, but don't do it all for them. I like to show them how to get started or help them get started and let them do the rest once they know a process.
- Try and pick up on what the kdis want to do the most. We can switch things around based on what the majority wants to do.
	- e.g. if eveyrone wants to make their own advancements, we (I) can look into how to do it and we can throw it in on Thursday, which I think should basically be "Miscellaneous and things ninjas wanna try as a group"
- I also need to make new instructions or find new instructions for installing forge 1.18.2 and their mod after they leave
