## Visual
- For the block textures, double click on each blank area and it'll let you choose from the textures that have been made. If you choose a Normal Block model on the right side, it'll let you choose textures for each side. This should be the setting by default.
- The Block Tint will apply the same tinting that applies to Grass blocks and Leaves etc.
	- The Tint Block Item? will apply the same tint to the actual item
- Block Base and Block Item Texture should be left alone always.
	- The Block Item Texture just lets you choose an item texture for the block, if they really want to do that for some reason.
	- The Block base setting is used to make [[Codeninjas Camps/Minecraft Modding/Not Full Blocks|stairs, slabs, leaves etc.]], but I need to look into how the textures need to actually be made for this
- For Block Model just leave it as Normal or Single Texture, the other options don't do much for us. Single texture applies the same texture to all sides. Normal lets you choose textures for each side.
- Rotation Mode lets you choose how the block rotates it's texture if it's placed from different sides. 
- Waterloggable only works on stairs, slabs, leaves, etc.
- Transparency should be left as default
- Special information empty
