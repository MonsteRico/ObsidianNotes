# Rhetorical Situation
- The rhetorical situation is a specific set of [[Rhetoric|rhetorical]] devices that make up a text
	- Topic - What am I writing about?
	- Purpose - Why am I writing this?
	- Audience/Context - Who is this intended for? What do they already know about my topic?
	- [[Genre]] - What conventions should I follow?
	- Angle - What about this topic is new or significant?
- No two texts have the same rhetorical situation
- If we know the purpose we can usually choose an appropriate genre easily
- We can choose the elements of a rhetorical situation to build any piece of writing we need
	- example - [[Rhetorical Analysis]] would break into
		- Topic: Use of [[Rhetoric]] in a text
		- Angle: How is an author using rhetoric (in)effectively? 
		- Purpose: To analyze
		- Audience: Varies (usually someone familiar with the text or field)


## Topic
- What am I being asked to write about?
- Topics usually are given and known about prior to writing
- Once a topic is known, find a scope of what's inside and outside your topic
- A good way of doing this is with a concept map, like the one in these notes


## Purpose
- What do you want to accomplish?
- Usually relates to a thesis statement
- Sometimes the purpose is given in the assignment
- What do you believe about your topic?
- What do you want to prove?
- Are you trying to **inform** your readers? Or **persuade** them?
- Your purpose often helps you identify a genre for your paper as well

## Audience
- When writing it is important to keep in mind your intended audience
- Create a brief reader profile by asking questions like the following
	- Who are my readers?
	- What are their expectations?
	- What will they be reading?
	- Where will they read this?
	- When will they read this?
	- Why are they reading it?
	- What do they need or want from this text?
	- What do my readers believe or value?
- The better we understand an audience the better we can present our text
	- For example, in a rhetorical analysis the reader may not have read your article, so a summary would be useful

## Context
- Involves a lot of the external influences that will shape readers interpretation of our writing
- How will our audience experience our writing?
	- "Where" will they read? Online, a video etc.
	- "How" will they read? Print, digital, or a non-written message?
	- How will they be influenced socially, politically, or otherwise?
		- Your audience may value different things from you, so that has to be taken into account too


## Genre
[[Genre]]

## Angle
- What is new about the topic?
- Your unique perspective or view on an issue
- Good ways to find an angle are
	- What has changed about this topic that makes it interesting right now?
	- What unique experiences, expertise, or knowledge do I have on this topic?
