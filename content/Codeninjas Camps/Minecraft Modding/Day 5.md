# Day 5
## Minecraft Mods explanation
- How do Minecraft mods actually work?
	- Minecraft mods are written in a language called Java, as is Minecraft itself. We make mods in MCreator which turns the mods into code for us automatically.
	- Right click any mod element and open it in the code editor to see the actual code that makes that mod element work. Be careful, editing this will make it not work!
- What is Forge?
	- Forge is a modloader for Minecraft.
	- Basically Forge is able to read the files that mods are saved in and lets Minecraft actually accept them
## Export mods to .zip
- We will first export our mods to a .zip file. This lets you continue editing your mod at home, so long as you download MCreator.
- They will need to follow along closely
- In MCreator, first click Workspace at the top, then Workspace settings.
	- Rename the mod to whatever they want to call it. **ONLY CHANGE THE IN GAME NAME**, leave the other names as they are for ease.
	- Click "Save Changes" when done
- Click "Export Workspace to a Shareable ZIP". Careful, since the one below that is very similar but not the same.
- Save the file to the Desktop for ease, and have them name it their name
- When saving mods to flashdrives they can put that file on the flashdrives
## Export mods to .jar
- In MCreator, on the top right click this icon

  - Everyone will be exporting their mods at once, which may take some time
  - A popup will come up asking for donations. Click "Export the mod without donating"

  - Save the mod.jar file to the Desktop again and have them name it their name
  - This file can also be put on flashdrives when parents arrive
## Load mods into Minecraft
- Close out of everything and go back to the Desktop
- On the bottom left of the screen should be a search bar. Click on it and then type "%appdata%" without the quotes. Then press enter. It will open a folder. Have them wait here while you check and make sure they all got it.
- In this folder, double click the .minecraft folder. Then double click the mods folder.
- Copy the mod.jar file from the Desktop into this folder, then close out of it.
