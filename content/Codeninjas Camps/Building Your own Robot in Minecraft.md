# Building Your Own Robot in Minecraft

- Overall the slides for this camp are actually really good, just follow them. The only thing I have to add personally is the beginning "Novice" part where it says you should do it on the screen and have them watch, yeah don't just have them watch actually have them do it with you. Or watch it and then do it. They shouldn't just watch that part and then do Intermediate, they should do it themselves too IMO.
- Another thing is the last thing in the camp involves letting them kind of just work on the other coding difficulties/languages within the current lesson. This is fine as long as it's not with an hour left, maybe even 30 minutes. If you give them too much time to mess around in this they will take it and play Minecraft. My recommendation is potentially do a Build Battle, Redstone Tutorial, the Minecraft Bingo etc. to eat up a little of that time and get them doing something interactive but still fun. The activities at the beginning of each PowerPoint are good as well for 10-15 mins plus 10-15 mins of freetime at the start while everyone arrives.
- Minecraft Education Edition DOES allow multiplayer and it SOMETIMES works, don't know why. One person has to host and then the others join through the join code. It's pretty simple. It does work as long as everyone's using the CodeNinjas accounts, including the Sensei whos hosting if they are. 
- They like to do really big numbers, those can make the computer lag so make sure they know big numbers are generally bad. If you ever need to kill all mobs or something you can do
	- `/kill @e[type=zombie]` or `/kill @e[type=!player]` or etc.
	- also the commands `/time set day` and `/weather clear` are useful to know
- In settings they can change personal game mode if needed

# Day 1
- Log in to education editions and play around until everyone gets there - 10-15 mins
- camp introductions and rules etc. - 5-10 mins
- Build Battle for warmup, 10-15 mins
- Sequencing, talk about sequencing
	- Novice sequencing - 30 mins
	- Intermediate Sequencing - 30 mins
- Break - 10-15 mins
- Events talk about events
	- Novice events - 30 mins
	- intermediate events - 30 mins
- Either advanced sequencing or advanced events or both - rest of time
	- Events application from the PowerPoint doesn't work
# Day 2
- Free time beginning for 10-15
- Pixel Portraits warmup - 10-15 mins
	- Subject Kits, Art and Design, Pixel Portraits
- Variables, talk about variables
	- Novice variables - 30
	- Intermediate Variables - 30
- Break - 10-15
- Expert Variables but here's the final code b/c the one they  have is broken - 30-45
	- ![[Codeninjas Camps/Pasted image 20220628112510.png]]
- Do the Application in Variables, have them try and make the agent place some of the blocks! - rest of time, add free time at end if really necessary but should be good

# Day 3
- Freetime until everyone arrives - 10-15 mins
- Build A Moat - 10-15 mins
	- It's in art and design
	- Encourage use of the agent, although chances are they won't use it
	- Try and use the agent on screen to code a moat of some kind just to have them see coding in the background
- Novice Loops (Talk about loops as well) - 30 mins
- Intermediate Loops - 30 mins
- Break - 15 mins
- Constructive Activity - 10ish mins? Maybe shorter depending on the activity done.
	- Minecraft Bingo 
	- Build Battle
	- One of the other subject kit worlds
	- Sporcle Quizzes - [Ores Quiz](https://www.sporcle.com/games/lmasta/minecraft-underground-ores?t=minecraft), [Mobs Quiz](https://www.sporcle.com/games/Ihatekittens/minecraft-mobs?t=minecraft) (we did this it worked pretty well)
	- Redstone tutorial (has to work in bedrock though)
	- Something to kind of get away from the coding for a little bit, might be worth doing since this day is a little shorter
- Expert Loops - 30 mins
- Loops Application - 30 mins
- Code a farm in your own survival/creative world or with others - rest of time

# Day 4
- Freetime until everyone arrives - 10-15 mins
- Design an animal - 15 mins
- Novice Conditionals and talk about conditionals - 30 mins
- Intermediate Conditionals - 30 mins
- Break - 15 mins
- Expert Conditionals - 45 mins
	- The hints are messed up and the instructions can be kind of confusing so here's the full code
	- ![[Codeninjas Camps/Pasted image 20220630105218.png]]
- Application Conditionals - rest of time (30 mins)
	- This has you spawning animals based on the block you stand on
	- Check if the block at ~ 0 ~ 0 ~ 0 is potatoes and spawn a pig for example
	- For Wheat, the item in the code editor is "Crops"
	- They can only plant stuff on the dirt
	- Encourage them to work on this for at least 15 mins, the rest of the time can be spent in their own worlds if they want as long as they try and use the code. Do some mini coding project on screen to give them something to see in the background. I've been making a villager house only with the code.
# Day 5
- Freetime until everyone arrives - 10-15 mins
- Build A Monster - 10-15 mins
	- It's in art and design
- Novice Functions (Talk about functions as well) - 30 mins
- Intermediate Functions - 30 mins
- Break - 15 mins
- MINECRAFT BINGO! - 15 mins
- One of the other subject kits or ai or something idk yet
- Expert or freetime idk yet
- Code a farm in your own survival/creative world or with others - rest of time
