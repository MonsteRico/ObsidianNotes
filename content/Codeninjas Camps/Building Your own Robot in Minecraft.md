# Building Your Own Robot in Minecraft

Overall the slides for this camp are actually really good, just follow them. The only thing I have to add personally is the beginning "Novice" part where it says you should do it on the screen and have them watch, yeah don't just have them watch actually have them do it with you. Or watch it and then do it. They shouldn't just watch that part and then do Intermediate, they should do it themselves too.

Another thing is the last thing in the camp involves letting them kind of just work on the other coding difficulties/languages within the current lesson. This is fine as long as it's not with an hour left, maybe even 30 minutes. If you give them too much time to mess around in this they will take it and play Minecraft. My recommendation is potentially do a Build Battle, redstone tutorial, the Minecraft Bingo
