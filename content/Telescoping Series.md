# Telescoping Series

A telescoping series is a [[Series]] whose general term can be written as the difference of two consecutive terms in a sequence.

For example, $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k(k+1)} = \sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k+1}- \frac{1}{k+2}$ (after partial fraction expansion)

The partial sums of telescoping series only consist of two terms after cancellation.

good example

I didnt really take much notes on this so im kind at a loss
