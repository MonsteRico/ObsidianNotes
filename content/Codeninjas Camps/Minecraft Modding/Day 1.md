## Day 1 - Intro, Ore, Tools
- Play Minecraft until everyone arrives and gets logged in, just have them log in or use our accounts for singleplayer
- CAMP INTRO
  - Chris will go over general rules
  - As an icebreaker we do Name, Age/Grade, How long you've been playing Minecraft OR your favorite block/mob/item/biome/mod/etc.
- Have everyone start up MCreator and go into their Workspace.
-  Close computers halfway while we talk about textures
  - How does Minecraft do textures? (ask the ninjas)
  - It uses sprite sheets basically, pulling from the sprite sheet whatever face of the block is needed and putting it in the game
  - ![[Pasted image 20220621211602.png]]
  - It also "unfolds" mobs to allow for their full textures to be displayed
  - Talk more about how Minecraft does textures if you know and/or are stalling for time for some reason
- Make our first block
  - Make our own texture, completely custom (don't show templates yet)
  - Go create the block entity
  - Create a recipe for the block
  - Create a Creative Tab to hold our new block and all future stuff
    - Make the symbol our new block
  - Explain the different options available to use
- Play game and look @ our new block, build with it mess with it.
- Short break to let them mess around with recipe and block, maybe making new recipes for existing things.
- Come back together for an ore quiz smelting quiz etc
- Make our own ore, use texture maker and a random ore texture
- make the ingot/gem texture
- make the blocks and items
- Make the Smelting Recipe for the ore
- make it generate (part of making the ore)
- Find it in game!
  Rest of this is dependant on time
- Use the quick tools to make tools and armor for our ore
  - if someone wants to make custom textures we can help them do that
- if lots of time left add in potion effects to our armor or tools
  - intros the coding with very simple block code stuff
- At the end we do freeplay. make sure we pick up their ideas and what they wanna do to get some ideas ourselves
