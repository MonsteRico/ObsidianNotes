# Matthews wonderful apartment notes

Here's what I'm thinking.

# Options
## 3x3  Apt Hub - Nick/Kylee do whatever
- If Nick/Kylee wanted to live in Hub as well they'd be in same building with same amenities AND its pet friendly so they could
- ![[Pasted image 20220625160606.png]]
- One bathroom in room sadly, everything else looks like itd be fine. Rooms are small though
- Balcony is nice ig
- Pricing: $1075 for the above alone (balcony and one room with bathroom in it)
	- $1045 for one with no bacvl
## 4x4 Apt Hub - Nick with us still Kylee does something
- Kylee could live in Hub to be close since its pet friendly or whererever she wants, sorry doesn't impact me I'll help her look later
## 3x3 Apt Campus Edge - Nick/Kylee do whatever
- If Nick/Kylee wanted to live in Hub theyd be close but diff buildings and amenities and stuff. hard to bring milo to an apartment that doesnt allow pets too
## 4x4 Apt Campus Ege - Nick with us
- Kylee would have to figure something out, hub is closeby same as at hub though not my concern rn unfortunately
## 4x4(.5) Townhome Campus Edge - Nick with us still Kylee does something 
- Kylee could live in Hub to be close since its pet friendly or whererever she wants, sorry doesn't impact me I'll help her look later
## 4x4(.5) Townhome Campus Edge - Nick/Kylee do whatever
- If Nick/Kylee wanted to live in Hub theyd be close but diff buildings and amenities and stuff. easier to bring milo to a townhome that doesnt allow pets


# Hub
- [Hub](https://huboncampus.com/west-lafayette-state-street/)
- loud part of campus, seemed very party central first time i looked
- had sticky notes saying "Don't live here"
- most bathrooms not in rooms
- more expensive
- decent amenities, not exactly same as edge though
- OPPORTUNITY FOR A PRIVATE HOT TUB FOR 1000+ not that worth it but still
- pet friendly as long as its less than 30 lbs fully grown. milo cant be fat :)
- waitlist up for 23/24
- ive seen both good and bad reviews
# Campus Edge
- [Campus Edge on Pierce](https://www.americancampus.com/student-apartments/in/west-lafayette/campus-edge-on-pierce)
- a little set off from chauncey hill, so not AS bad in terms of loud part of campus probably
- doesn't allow more people on lease than rooms in an apartment
- really nice amenities
- living room layout kinda sucks everywhere but the 4x4.5 townhome
- the townhomes require us to have a 4th person
- most bathrooms not in rooms, some are
- has "deluxe" rooms where those people end up having to pay a little more rent
- not pet friendly apparently? even though i thought they were?
- registration for 23/24 opens in September
- ive seen both good and bad reviews

# Fuse
- [FUSE](https://www.liveatfuse.com/)
- expensive but nice supposedly
- no pool, but generally nice amenities it seems
- not pet friendly
- bathrooms not in rooms ever as far as i can tell
- i couldnt tour it, dont know anything else other than people say its not that bad
