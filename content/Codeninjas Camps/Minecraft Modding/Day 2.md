# Day 2 - Tools, Armor, Effects, Tree, Wood, Biome
- There's a lot happening on this day, but it all goes fairly quick
- Play Minecraft until everyone arrives. Start with 10 minutes of free time (camp starts 10 minutes in). This can be changed as needed or liked, I usually like to give some freetime at the start.
## Tools - 20 minutes
- First thing to do is make tools of our ore from yesterday
- Instead of having to make each individual tool, we can use MCreator to make all of the tools and recipes at once!
- Click the Create Tool Pack button ![[Codeninjas Camps/Minecraft Modding/Modding Pics/Pasted image 20220630100721.png]]
	- Change the base item of the Tool Pack to the gem they made yesterday
	- Add the word "Tools" to the name
	- Change the color if they want to change the colors of the tools
	- Power factor is relative to Iron, meaning 1 should be equivalent to Iron, 2 would be double Iron and so on.
- Once it generates all the tools and recipes, they can go into each tool's item and change the in game name and any other properties
- They can also go into all of the Recipes and change the recipes if they would like
- Have them go in the game and test out the recipes and tools
