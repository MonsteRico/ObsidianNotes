# Day 2 - Tools, Armor, Tree, Wood, Biome
- There's a lot happening on this day, but it all goes fairly quick
- Play Minecraft until everyone arrives. Start with 10 minutes of free time (camp starts 10 minutes in). This can be changed as needed or liked, I usually like to give some freetime at the start. Reduce time from the Tools/Armor section as needed, they probably won't take 30 minutes anyways but I allocated that much since we had large camp sizes. Break can also be shortened if needed.
## Tools - 30 minutes
- First thing to do is make tools of our ore from yesterday
- Instead of having to make each individual tool, we can use MCreator to make all of the tools and recipes at once!
- Click the Create Tool Pack button ![[Codeninjas Camps/Minecraft Modding/Modding Pics/Pasted image 20220630100721.png]]
	- Change the base item of the Tool Pack to the gem they made yesterday
	- Add the word "Tools" to the name
	- Change the color if they want to change the colors of the tools
	- Power factor is relative to Iron, meaning 1 should be equivalent to Iron, 2 would be double Iron and so on.
- Once it generates all the tools and recipes, they can go into each tool's item and change the in game name and any other properties
- They can also go into all of the Recipes and change the recipes if they would like
- Have them go in the game and test out the recipes and tools
- Give them time to mess around with the properties of the tools
## Armor - 30 mins
- Creating an armor pack is almost exactly the same as creating a tool pack
- The button is right next to the tool pack one, 
- ![[Pasted image 20220712151214.png]]
- Choose the main ore/material, choose a color, set power factor relative to iron, and add "Armor" to the name
- Same as before they can edit the recipes and the properties of the Armor
- The Armor shows up as one mod element to edit, you can change the in game names of each item here.
- If they want to change the properties of the armor they can, most of them are explained in their name or the question mark. Only thing they shouldn't change here is the textures
- If they want to modify the textures, it's possible but difficult.
	- Go to resources, theres a new textures for armor section.
	- The item textures and the armor textures themselves are different things that need to be modfied separately.
	- The armor texture is unwrapped similar to the mob textures you would have shown yesterday, which makes it confusing to edit but possible
	- The chest/helmet are on one texture and the boots/pants are on another
## Material Pack (faster making of ore, tools, armor, 20 mins)
- Now that we know how to make and edit both armor and tools, we will show a quick way to make a full ore and set of tools and blocks with it!
- In the same section as the armor pack and tool pack is the Material pack
- ![[Pasted image 20220712151837.png]]
	- The Icon right after that is an ore pack if they just want to make an ore
- You choose
	- name of the material eg. "silver", "diamond", "iron", "ninjaite"
	- whether its a gem, dust, or ingot
	- the color
	- the power relative to iron
- When you click create material pack, it will make a full set of tools, armor, and the ore/ingot for you all at once along with all the recipes.
- They can then go modify all of the generated textures, recipes, and items and change the properties to their liking
- Give them time to mess around with making these and changing properties, finding the ores and etc. to take up any remaining time before break.
## Break - 10-15 mins
## Biomes - 15 mins
- Talk about biomes with the kids
- What is a biome? What is a biome not in Minecraft? (basically have the same answer)
- What kind of blocks do we need in a biome? (wood, dirt, grass, stone, leaves)
- What are some Minecraft or real life biomes? (taiga, desert, plains etc)
- We are going to be creating our own biomes, so think about what kind of blocks and textures you want for it.
## Making Biome blocks - 45 mins
- Create the textures for the following blocks
	- A ground block (equivalent of grass)
	- An underground block (equivalent of dirt)
	- A tree log/stem block
	- A tree leaf block
- Once they make the textures, they can make the block mod elements and change the properties
- Have them test each of the blocks in game and make sure they look good, have the right properties they want, can be used in recipes etc.
## Make Biome - 30 mins
- Go through this once on the screen and have them watch, then do it AGAIN and have them follow along. OR go through it a few steps at a time altogether. Your choice
- Add a new mod element (green plus) and choose biome. Name the mod element whatever the name of the biome will be
- Choose the ground block to be your ground/grass block
- Choose the underground block to be your underground/dirt block
- Leave the underwater block blank
- They can change the name of the biome that will show up in game
- They can change any of the colors however they want, should be obvious what its changing
- Change it to say Custom trees at the bottom and fill in the blocks as appropriate
- Leave tree type as default
- Example biome with everything filled in as it should be (i didnt make proper textures for everything, I just used placeholder blocks). Everything circled can be changed
	- ![[Pasted image 20220712153731.png]]
- There are a LOT of properties and settings that can be changed for biomes, make use of the question mark giving an explanation and your own minecraft knowledge to interpret it all
- Here are some of the sections/major properties to change
	- 
## Free create - rest of time
