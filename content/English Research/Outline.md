# Thesis
Mass shootings are becoming a near daily occurrence, and people have many opinions as to why that is, whether it be relating to gun control, mental health, or video games. America continually tries to pin the blame for mass shootings on different issues instead of putting forth the effort it needs to solve this crisis.

# Intro
==Date 1, Location 1, death count 1. Date 2, location 2, death count 2. Date 3, location 3, death count 3==. The list could go on. In fact, ==it could go on for well over fifty locations==. No one likes to talk about it, but we have to acknowledge the unfortunate truth. There is an epidemic occurring in our country. Not one of a disease, or one of a way of thinking, but one of violence. The definition of a "mass shooting" is different depending on who you ask, almost any incident related to gun violence with one or more injuries (or fatalities) in the last few years has been labeled as a mass shooting. Regardless of the definition, there are many of these incidents every year, and after each and every one of them America blames the same few things. Americans blame video games, mental health, lack of gun control, issues with law enforcement, lack of or too much government involvement, democrats, republicans, they blame anything that could be remotely close to a cause. Yet no matter how much these reasons are spouted out by the media and the country, there's never any change. The problem isn't getting any better. Mass shootings are becoming a near daily occurrence, and people have many opinions as to why that is, whether it be relating to gun control, mental health, or video games. America continually tries to pin the blame for mass shootings on different issues instead of putting forth the effort it needs to solve this crisis.
