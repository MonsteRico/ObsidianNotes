# Day 2 - Tools, Armor, Tree, Wood, Biome
- There's a lot happening on this day, but it all goes fairly quick
- Play Minecraft until everyone arrives. Start with 10 minutes of free time (camp starts 10 minutes in). This can be changed as needed or liked, I usually like to give some freetime at the start. Reduce time from the Tools/Armor section as needed, they probably won't take 30 minutes anyways but I allocated that much since we had large camp sizes. Break can also be shortened if needed.
## Tools - 30 minutes
- First thing to do is make tools of our ore from yesterday
- Instead of having to make each individual tool, we can use MCreator to make all of the tools and recipes at once!
- Click the Create Tool Pack button ![[Codeninjas Camps/Minecraft Modding/Modding Pics/Pasted image 20220630100721.png]]
	- Change the base item of the Tool Pack to the gem they made yesterday
	- Add the word "Tools" to the name
	- Change the color if they want to change the colors of the tools
	- Power factor is relative to Iron, meaning 1 should be equivalent to Iron, 2 would be double Iron and so on.
- Once it generates all the tools and recipes, they can go into each tool's item and change the in game name and any other properties
- They can also go into all of the Recipes and change the recipes if they would like
- Have them go in the game and test out the recipes and tools
- Give them time to mess around with the properties of the tools
## Armor - 30 mins
- Creating an armor pack is almost exactly the same as creating a tool pack
- The button is right next to the tool pack one, 
- ![[Pasted image 20220712151214.png]]
- Choose the main ore/material, choose a color, set power factor relative to iron, and add "Armor" to the name
- Same as before they can edit the recipes and the properties of the Armor
- The Armor shows up as one mod element to edit, you can change the in game names of each item here.
- If they want to change the properties of the armor they can, most of them are explained in their name or the question mark. Only thing they shouldn't change here is the textures
- If they want to modify the textures, it's possible but difficult.
	- Go to resources, theres a new textures for armor section.
	- The item textures and the armor textures themselves are different things that need to be modfied separately.
	- The armor texture is unwrapped similar to the mob textures you would have shown yesterday, which makes it confusing to edit but possible
	- The chest/helmet are on one texture and the boots/pants are on another
## Material Pack (faster making of ore, tools, armor, 20 mins)
- Now that we know how to make and edit both armor and tools, we will show a quick way to make a full ore and set of tools and blocks with it!
- In the same section as the armor
## Break - 15 mins
## Biomes - 15 mins
## Custom textures for our blocks - 15 mins
## Other Biome blocks - 30 mins
## Make Biome - 30 mins
## Free create - rest of time
