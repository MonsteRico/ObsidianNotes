# Quotes/Thoughts
- 332 shootings that involved 1 or more people getting injured or killed this year alone, starting Jan 1.
- Even just looking at the shootings on this list where at least one person died, theres over 90 entries. And these are all just in this year alone.
- Whether we like to believe it or not, mass shootings are prevalent in this country. They're an epidemic that needs our attention.
- Going back to 2021 data, we find that there were 692 incidents considered mass shootings in that year. 
- 2020 - 610
- 2019 - 417
- 2018 - 336
- at the current rate, with 332 at around halfway through the year, there will end up being around 650-700 this year. Nearing 2021 levels already, and I sadly would not be surprised to see it go past.
- and all these numbers have been verified as of this year. Not all online information is necessarily 100% accurate, however this is a consistent increase no matter how you look at it.
